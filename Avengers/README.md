# Main idea of a project:

In a designated field where Thanos has hidden the Infinity Stone, our objective is to locate this powerful artifact without encountering the Avengers.
The exact locations of potential obstacles are unknown, prompting us to survey the area using visual sectors to navigate safely.

# Detail description with story:

According to the Marvel Comics, Thanos is looking for the Infinity Stones to terminate
half of the living creatures in the Universe, and Avengers at the same time try to prevent this.
In one of the Marvel’s alternative realities Thanos tries to find one of the Infinity Stones.
Currently, he has no stones collected and he just recognized the location of the first one. This
stone is located on a very far planet. Thanos is a very strong creature, however, without Infinity
Gauntlet filled with Infinity Stones his power is very limited. Therefore, he tries to avoid the
Avengers sent to the same planet and aiming not to give Thanos to realize his ambitions. The
location of the Avengers is unknown to him, but he also knows that only 4 of them were able
to achieve this planet: Captain Marvel, Captain America, Thor and Hulk. Therefore, it may be
completely unsafe to follow the expected shortest path, Thanos may die.
Unintentionally Thanos met with Captain America and had a fight with him, after which
both of them were exhausted, Captain America even lost his sa made of vibranium after
throwing it aiming to hit Thanos. The vibranium is famous for its extraordinary abilities to
absorb, store, and release large amounts of kinetic energy. Because of exhaustive fight Captain
America was delivered back to the spaceship by other Avengers. The remaining 3 Avengers
decided to go the different places of the planet to look for Thanos, because they had no idea
where the Infinity Stone could be located. Thanos understands that each of the remaining
Avengers is powerful enough to make him stuck in one more exhaustive fight. Therefore, his
strategy is to avoid his enemies. Each of his enemies is having different power.
Thor is a God of Thunder from Asgard which is owning the Stormbreaker and Mjölnir,
sentient enchanted weapons created out of Uru metal forged with the heat of a dying star in the
Dwarven kingdom of Nidavellir. These weapons are enhancing the power of Thor and can even
kill Thanos. To defend himself at least from long distance attacks of Stormbreaker and Mjölnir
Thanos has to find the lost Shield of Captain America. Defeating Thor by Thanos is impossible
without Infinity Gauntlet. That is the reason to avoid a fight with former. However, finding of
the Shield is not a requirement, because it may increase the path. But in some cases, it may
extremely helpful.
Hulk is a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a limitless degree
of physical strength. His power and speed are limited only by the level of its anger. Obviously,
defeat of Captain America made him very angry on Thanos. Hulk prefers close combats, but
for ranged combats he uses hand-clapping creating shock waves. He is almost immortal, but
can be defeated by cutting his head. Still, because of reincarnation ability Hulk will survive,
but decapitation can neutralize him till the end of the game. To make this possible some really
strong metal has to be applied, and Shield of Captain America made of vibranium is an option.
Captain Marvel is superhumanly strong thanks both to her hybrid organism and to her
ability of enhancing her physique by absorbing energy. The Shield of Captain America is
useless in fight against her and the best thing to do for Thanos is just not to get too close to
Captain Marvel.
You need to help Thanos to find the Infinity Stone, which location is known to only to
Thanos. Avengers are static enemies located somewhere on the map. Your environment is 9*9
square lattice, which represents a partial map of a planet (see Figure 1).
